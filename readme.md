# FMC Buddy
FMC Buddy is your buddy for FMC!
FMC Buddy uses [cubing.js](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/) to help you practice FMC!

If you're just interested in using FMC Buddy, you can find it at [FMCBuddy.com](https://fmcbuddy.com)

How to run:
* After cloning, run `npm install`
  * This may be necessary to run again after pulling or adding any new dependencies.
* Run `npm run dev` to spin it up!

FMCBuddy.com supports:
*  Adding more branches (better/more usable support coming soon)
* Inverse moves in ()
*  Swapping the view to the inverse at any point/back to the normal
*  comments notated by //
*  Import your own scrambles
*  Support to drag views around.
*  60 minute countdown timer
*  Minimizing/maximizing views

Things in the pipeline:
*  Auto comments
*  Marking views as bad/good
*  Input for writing all EOs down that autogenerates branches with those EOs
*  Linking between views
*  Option to display inverse
*  Better mobile support (good reason to download Sean's cube keyboard if you haven't already!)
*  Create a new view from another view

I'm hoping to make this useful for general practice, so please let me know if you'd like to see a feature!  Feel free to request it on GitHub/ping me!  Feel free to contribute as well!
