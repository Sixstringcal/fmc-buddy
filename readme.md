# FMC Buddy
FMC Buddy is your buddy for FMC!
FMC Buddy uses [cubing.js](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/) to help you practice FMC!

If you're just interested in using FMC Buddy, you can find it at [FMCBuddy.com](https://fmcbuddy.com)

How to run:
* After cloning, run `npm install`
  * This may be necessary to run again after pulling or adding any new dependencies.
* Run `npm run dev` to spin it up!

FMCBuddy.com supports:
* Adding multiple views/branches 
  * Click + on a view to copy that view/link it.
  * Highlight then press + to copy a specific part
* Inverse moves in ()
* Swapping the view to the inverse at any point/back to the normal
* comments notated by //
* Import your own scrambles
* Support to drag views around.
* 60 minute countdown timer
* Minimizing views
* Marking views as bad/good
* Option to display inverse

Things in the pipeline:
* Auto comments
* Input for writing all EOs down that autogenerates branches with those EOs
* Better mobile support (good reason to download Sean's cube keyboard if you haven't already!)

I'm hoping to make this useful for general practice, so please let me know if you'd like to see a feature!  Feel free to request it on GitHub/ping me!  Feel free to contribute as well!
